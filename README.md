## `Decisions`

Decided to use FETCH API due to the small scope of the project. Other option was using Axios, but that would require more imports and for a small project like this I prefer to keep the scope small.

Decided not to spend any time on media queries or catering to different sizes and shapes of various devices for now. Outside of scope.

## `Dependencies`

## `Scripts`

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
